<h1>DinoGame</h1> 
<p>DinoGame is, hopefully, going to be a 2d game engine for python platformers that uses pygame for rendering.</p>
<p>Its going to feature physics , world saving/loading, collisions, a camera system and way more.</p>
<p>Still in early stages so not a great idea to use it for a project as is</p>
